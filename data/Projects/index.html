      <p>Here are some of my projects that I have abandoned for a long time:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Discord bots: <a href="https://replit.com/@phanhoang1366/DelightfulPristineWatchdog-1" class="text-blue-500 visited:text-purple-500">Just a test bot</a>, created when I was in grade 10 and is now under maintenance. I also made <a href="https://github.com/phanhoang1366/dc-bot-rewrite" class="text-blue-500 visited:text-purple-500">NotDyno</a>, when I tried the new syntax for discord.py.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/phanhoang1366/soggy-autobuilds" class="text-blue-500 visited:text-purple-500">Soggy autobuilds</a>, just a simple CI intergrated into a project.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/phanhoang1366/OnlineJudgeDeploy" class="text-blue-500 visited:text-purple-500">OnlineJudge</a>, a fork of LuyenCode's own online judge for Le Hong Phong High School that went unused, which is also a fork.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That's pretty much it! I don't know many more projects that I can think of.</p>
