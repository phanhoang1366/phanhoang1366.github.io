      <p>This is my personal homepage that is designed to be as light and unintuitive as possible.</p>
      <p>Based on <a href="http://flare-on.com" class="text-blue-400 visited:text-purple-400"> Flare-On </a> website, where you have to navigate through a terminal, I decided to also test my own website this way.</p>

      <p>My name is Phan Huy Hoang (hence the 'phan' and 'hoang' in the username, I'm not sure about the numbers though.) I'm currently studying at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HEDSPI Program), with student code 20235729.</p>
      <p>My all-time favorite thing is Linux. Something is really special about it: It can be found almost anywhere you go! From smartphones, TVs, to even the websites that you are using daily, almost all powered by Linux. Maybe one day, I will go deep into this operating system. Maybe.</p>
      <p>Are my grades good? No, it's like a rollercoaster. Sometimes I will get 9-10 mark at class, but only 7 or 8 when I have a test every term. "Hoc tai, thi phan", they said. I will have to try harder at this university.</p>
      <p>Some notable achievements at school:</p>

      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>First prize in English 12 and second prize in English 11 (province-wide)</li>
        <li>IELTS 7.25 (yeah, that happened)</li>
        <li>Got a perfect mark at school after choosing 5 answers randomly in MCQ</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Oh, and also, I'm a weeb too!</p>

      <p>Alright, that's enough. See you next time!</p>
